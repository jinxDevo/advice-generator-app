## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com) - css with superpowers
- screen view responstivity
- core javascript (try..catch , fetch API , custom error)
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) - random advice API

### Continued development

The method of linking pages via the fetch API is a very amazing and effective method that has many useful and easy-to-use techniques that can be used instead of HTTPRequest techniques.
